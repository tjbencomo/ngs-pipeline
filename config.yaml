# Sequencing Type
# For whole exome, specify WES
# For whole genome, specify WGS
# If you have both WES and WGS samples, process them separately with 2 versions of this pipeline
# This is needed as the data types require different computational resources and genomic regions to interrogate
sequencing_type: WES

# Genomic Regions
# Uncompressed BED (.bed) file with regions for variant calling. Must be specified!
# For WES data, coverage is evaluated based on reads in these regions
# For WGS data, coverage is evaluated across the genome in 500 bp windows
